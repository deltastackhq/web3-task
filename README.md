# Agnostico web3 Task

Agnostico is a protocol designed to enable easy deploying, sharing and selling smart contract codebases.

This contract has been hidden with subtle bugs and severity see if you can find the errors.

## How it works

**Sharing code:** Codes are added to IPFS through the uploading of the contract files along with the 'AgnoDocs' describing them for the platform to process.

**Deploying code:** Agnostico selects the code supplied by the user along with the constructor arguments, if any, then sends it to the compiling server. The compiled bytecode is then sent to Agnostico's smart contract for deployment to the blockchain.
